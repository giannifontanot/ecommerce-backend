# E-Commerce Backend
This project is aimed to help a small business organize its inventory. This small business sells PRODUCTS which are 
grouped into CATEGORIES and each one of those products can receive as many TAGS as it needs to get the best 
description in the store. The database we use as developers to store the data is made out of 4 tables (Categories, Products, Tags, and the bridge table Product-Tags) and are related using foreign keys. This project was very interesting to develop, because it uses a library called Sequelize, which abstracts the SQL into regular Javascript code in order to help the developer to be more efficient.
